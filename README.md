# ArgoCD
Here is an overview of the steps to set up Argo CD on a Kubernetes cluster and configure it to use the "app of apps" method:

Install the Argo CD command-line tool (argocd) on your local machine. You can download the latest version from the Argo CD releases page on GitHub (https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases).

Install Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
This command creates the argocd namespace and deploys the Argo CD server, application controller, and other necessary resources to your cluster.

Verify that the Argo CD components are running by running the following command:
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n argocd
Access the Argo CD web UI by running the following command:
Copy code
argocd login localhost:8080
To configure Argo CD to use the "app of apps" method, you will need to create an application with the type set to "Application". You can do this through the Argo CD web UI or by using the argocd command-line tool.
